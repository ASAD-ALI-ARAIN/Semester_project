Library Management System

It‚Äôs our second semester in which we were assigned a project named LMS ‚ÄúLibrary Management System‚Äù. Library Management System is a system that maintains the information about the available books in the library,their authors, and the members of the library to whom books are issued and returned. This is very difficult to organize manually. But LMS reduces the workload of management as most of the manual work done is reduced.
